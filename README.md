Hi! This is my simple python flask application to allow metaphor to display news articles written about cars on current day. Maybe I can add a widget for my homescreen so I can view these articles instead of the political articles I see on Apple News that I don't really have an interest in.

I wanted to add summarization via chatgpt, but it went over the limit for tokens/requests per minute.

In the future I plan on adding if I spent longer than 3 hours on this project:
- Test cases
- ChatGPT summarization
- A fancier UI
- ChatGPT for suggesting more articles/youtube videos/tweets related to this article? Allows for deep diving into interesting topics/news articles.

Notes:
- Metaphor kept suggesting to use keyword searches for things like "Find me the best car deal from this week", I wish it would be able to query/scrape the web in real time to allow functionality like this!
- Metaphor search is better doing twitter or news article scraping rather than unorganized sites like forum pages or car bidding sites like bringatrailer.
- Metaphor really likes crypto and finance stuff on reddit, it'll ignore my query to show results from those subreddits.
